# **CHANGELOG**

# ***UPDATE 2.2.3 - 7/25/2024***

## STANDARDS UPDATES -

- Moving to Straight pieces with a length which is a multiple of 30mm (30/60/120/240) instead of the previous 20mm multiples (20/40/80/160/220) this change will allow for a simplified Stacking experience with less need for Lovejoys when Stacking, because 30mm is the base multiple of Inter Track Distance. x20mm Tracks will still be available for download incase you find a compelling reason to keep using them.

- New updated Dovetail Key design supersedes the earlier Straight Key design. This new design allows Keys to now add retention in the Y axis as well as the X Axis. This is essential to reliable spill-free operation of the new Marble Pump! (New Key specification drawing posted on the Design Guide)

## NEW ANGLE NAMING CONVENTION RELEASED -

- New standardized naming convention for all Angular Tracks, which removes unique names and the old wildcard length symbols and instead specifies the supplementary angle (indicated by symbol <) and diameter of the tessellated Track loop in units of ITD (indicated by symbol D)

- Pieces renamed due to adoption of the new Angular Naming Standard -
    - [R1] ↔ 15 is now known as [<90-D1]
    - [R2] ↔ 30 is now known as [<90-D2]
    - [R3] ↔ 60 is now known as [<90-D3]
    - [R4] ↔ 90 is now known as [<90-D4]
    - [TE] ↔ * is now known as [<60-D2]
    - [TRD] ↔ * is now known as []
