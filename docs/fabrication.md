# **TRACK FABRICATION GUIDE**

---

### **INTRODUCTION**

Are you are interested in fabricating your own Track Stacker sets for yourself and your loved ones? If you have access to an FDM 3D printer, some basic hand tools and standard metric hardware, you too can be creating your own Track Stacker sets from the comfort of your home!

A few Tracks call for the fabrication of acrylic cover plates and need a CNC laser cutter, though 3D printed cover plates have been tested to work nicely as well.

### **INGREDIENTS**

There are five fundamental materials required in order to create your own TrackStacker Sets -
	
- 10mm Glass Marbles
- Neodymium Magnets ⌀6mm ↧2mm
- Neodymium Magnets ⌀8mm ↧3mm
- PLA Filament 
- M2 x 4mm Socket Head Cap Screws

### **3D PRINTER SETTINGS**

In order to print your own TrackStacker Tracks successfully, your 3D printer will need to be capable of printing dimensionally accurate PLA parts, with a build volume of 200mm x 200mm x 150mm or greater. TrackStacker labs uses the BambuLabs X1C + AMS Combo for all in house Track Production, however just about 3D Printer from the last 10 years can be setup for fabricating Tracks.

No matter what printer you decide to use, reliably achieving dimensional accuracy is critical for Track production. Even small inaccuracies in dimension can make the fitment of magnets and marbles frustrating, and lead to magnets not staying in their pockets and marbles jamming in their tracks.

Before you start production on your own set, make sure to also take the time to tune your other 3D printer settings including support settings, elephant’s foot compensation and the alignment of blobs from Z seams.

Getting your print settings absolutely dialed in before you begin production will mean having to do minimal post processing on every part you make, saving lots of time and effort that could be better spent playing!

It is recommended to print all parts for Track Stacker using PLA or any of its variants with the following settings for best finish quality and strength -

- Layer Height : 0.2mm
- Walls : 4
- Infill : 20% density, Tri-Hexagon pattern
- Supports : Standard
- Adhesion : Brims 

If you have a machine capable of multi material printing, you can set up your slicer to print the name and length codes in a second highlight color, adding both functionality and flair. All of the .STL files provided are multi body with the first layer text separated out to ease multi material printing.

### **3D PRINT FINISHING**
After you have finished 3D printing your parts, it is now time for post processing your prints and getting them ready for magnetization! It is recommended to post process large batches of parts at the same time.

The first step will be the removal of supports (if you used them) We recommend a small flat head screwdriver for prying supports off from the magnet pockets, keyway slots and any other features that may have required support. With good support settings, this should be very easy to do, all the supported features being shallow pockets with ease of access for removal.

After all supports have been removed, conduct a thorough visual inspection of the part making sure there are no stray blobs, strings, wisps or other artifacts that may affect the quality and reliability of the finished Track. Use your fingers or a small file and flush cutters to trim away any artifacts.

If there is any elephants foot on the part, use a small flat file to file away the elephants foot, especially on the mating surfaces between Tracks. Failure to do this will result in Tracks becoming poorly aligned at connections causing marble jams.

Take the time to make sure each part meets all the above criteria for accuracy and finish to ensure the most enjoyable playtime Stacking experience!

### **SOURCING MAGNETS**

There are two different sizes of neodymium magnets you will need to insert into your 3D printed parts to create finished Tracks. These two sizes of magnets are at the very heart of TrackStacker.

- Neodymium Magnets ⌀8mm ↧3mm - Also known as Board Magnets, these are typically responsible for attaching each Track to the Play Surface.
- Neodymium Magnets ⌀6mm ↧2mm - Also known as Con Magnets, these are typically responsible for attaching Tracks to each other.

You can source small neodymium fridge magnets in these sizes from online stores in most countries. Beware of ceramic or ferrite magnets, though much cheaper than neodymium they are too brittle and magnetically weak to function properly in TrackStacker.

### **SETTING MAGNETS**

You will need some tools to properly set your magnets. A dead blow hammer, a flat stable and solid work surface about 200mm x 200mm and a set of small pin punches will make the process of setting magnets much easier. This approach is usually fine for setting small quantities of magnets, but you may want to invest in a Vice or Arbor Press based setting system if you intend to fabricate LARGE quantities of Tracks.

Track Stacker is designed to use a tight friction fit for the magnets such that no adhesive is necessary in assembly. However, if you find your magnets falling out of their pockets in play due to poor 3D printer tolerances, you can use a small dab of gel superglue when setting your magnets to ensure longevity of the finished Track.

### **POLARITY**

Setting your magnets with the correct polarity is essential for your finished Tracks to pass the final Function Test with flying colors. Since magnet polarity is invisible, you will need a compass or Source of Truth tool to make sure the polarity of your Track Stacker set matches the polarity of other sets around the world. To make this process easy you can directly purchase a Source of Truth tool from the store, but if you are unable to purchase one, the procedure for determining and setting magnetic polarity yourself is described below
