# **The Design Guide**

The Track Stacker Design Guide is a living document that captures the entire set of standards, technical information, drawings, hardware, processes, principles and logic that informs the design of every single Track, and considers the ways in which Tracks shall be combined for the best Stacking experience for the Player.

The Design Guide is broken up into sections that compartmentalize each aspect of Track Stackerâ€™s fundamental standards with technical drawings, descriptions and context for each design choice. This is to provide contributors with as much context as possible to integrate new designs into the Track Stacker Cinematic Universe!

The Design Guide is broken up into the following subsections -


- ## **[The Standard](/design/standard)**

- ## **[Mechanisms](/design/mechanisms)**

- ## **[Aesthetics](/design/aesthetics)**

- ## **[Principles](/design/principles)**
