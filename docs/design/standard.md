# **TrackStacker Standard - Version 2.2.3**

The TrackStacker Standard is the most current set of technical specifications and dimensions that govern the creation of TrackStacker Track geometry. For a Track to be truly compatible and compliant with the TrackStacker ecosystem, it must follow all the guidelines laid out in The Standard.

In addition to these technical specifications, Tracks should be designed to conform to the Aesthetics and Principles of TrackStacker. 

## **The Magic Profile**

The Profile of Track Stacker is the most fundamental design element in the system. The interface between every Track must match The Profile. The Profile describes the size and position of the Marble Track, Con Magnets, Key and outer profile.

In general, many Track ideas start as Extrude or Sweep operations starting with The Magic Profile. It

## **Length Standards (Y Axis)**

Each Track in the TrackStacker system will be designed to conform to a multiple of 10mm in length, as represented by the â†” designator. This design constraint is to ensure that multiple Sub Stacks in parallel can be made to follow different routes, and then re-align at the end so the Sub Stacks may be merged.
