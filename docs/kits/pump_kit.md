# **The Marble Pump Kit!** 

The Marble Pump is a bidirectional pump that can lift a stack of marbles against the force of gravity to create self-recirculating Stacks! The Track is powered off USB Type C Power Delivery (PD), and will take your Stacking experience into the realm of mesmerizing, hypnotizing Perpetual Stacks!

The Marble Pump is the beating heart of the TrackStacker ecosystem, and is the first ever powered Track! The Pump is powered by USB C Power Delivery (PD) and has 3 DIP switches to select one of 5 possible PD voltages (5V, 9V, 12V, 15V and 20V) to give you 5 speeds to choose from, or to match your Pump to the power supply you have available.

The Marble Pump is fully reversible, and can pump marbles in either direction. This feature is very useful for bleeding marbles out of a Stack when cleaning up!
