# **The Z Expansion Kit!** 

The Z Expansion Kit is designed to get you off the Play surface and building Tracks in free space! 

There are 3 levels of Z in the Z expansion kit - [Z1], [Z2], [Z3] and 3 matching heights of supports - [ZS1], [ZS2], [ZS3] 

All Z Tracks and Z Supports can be combined additively to reach levels beyond Z3!
