# **Kits!** 

Though there are numerous Tracks in the Library, we have curated a few select Tracks into Track 'Kits', to give you a useful and feature packed starting point to dive into the endless world of TrackStacker!

I am currently working on building a very thorough documentation for each Kit, including demo Stacks and starting points to get you inspired! Please be patient with me as I do all the writing, editing and photography needed to give you the best Stacking experience possible!
