!!! note 

	2T1 is shown in the image above in the 1 Input to 2 Output configuration.  

## **Overview**

2-to-1 / 1-to-2 (henceforth referred to as 2T1) is a Switch that is a capable of routing a marble from 1 Input Track to one of 2 Output Tracks or from 2 Input Tracks to one of 2 Output Tracks! You can change how the Track behaves simply by flipping it upside down.

## **Application Notes**

2T1 is primarily used for routing marbles and effectively 'selecting' which SubStack the next marble in the queue is about to be sent to. This can be set up either in a merging (2-to-1) or diverging (1-to-2) action based on the orientation of the Track.

## **Operational Principle**

2T1 uses magnetic detents in order to stably index the position of the switch at its three desired endpoints. A magnetic detent uses the force of attraction between two magnets to create these stable, precisely indexed locations. The 'strength' or 'snappiness' of the detent can be controlled by altering the physical distance between the two attracting magnets.
