## **Overview**

The LoveJoy family of Tracks solves a fundamental issue that comes up when Stacking : How to have Straight Tracks with a variable length? LoveJoy is a two-part Track that solves this issue, and can be configured and used in a multitude of other ways!  

It is currently available in one size - [LJ1], but more lengths are coming soon!

!!! note 

	[LJ1] is shown in the image above in the compressed (top) and extended (bottom) configurations!

## **Length Notes**

**[LJ1] â†” 40-70** can be used at its 45mm length fully compressed, at its full extension of 70mm, or any variable length in between!

## **Application Notes**

LoveJoys are a highly modular and reconfigurable Track, which can be set up in a number of ways to achieve various different functions -

- ### **Variable Length Straight -**

	LoveJoy can be compressed and extended to any length between its two length limits. You can adjust the length simply by sliding the two halves of LoveJoy to the desired length, and inserting it into your Stack.

- ### **Creating Curves -**

	When close to the limit of its extended configuration, LoveJoy provides a small amount of angular deviation. A large number of LoveJoys can be combined sequentially to approximate segmented curves using this technique.    

- ### **Splitting LoveJoys -**
	
	A LoveJoy can also be split completely into its two halves and each half can be used independently as a skeleton Straight Track if you need a little more length. This can be done simply by splitting the two halves of the Track and placing them back-to-back or mixing them with conventional Straight Tracks on either side.

## **Operational Principle**

The Double Button use a magnetic spring in order to create the spring force needed to reset the Track. A magnetic spring uses the force of repulsion between two magnets to create the necessary spring force. The 'strength' or 'snappiness' of the spring can be controlled by altering the number and size of the magnets in the repulsive pairs.
