The Inline Valve is a compact, momentary valve that can be used to launch an entire stack of marbles all at once simply with the push push of a button! This makes it easy to dump a **huge number** of marbles into a Stack instantaneously!

## **Application Notes**

## **Operational Principle**

The Inline Valves use a magnetic spring in order to create the spring force needed to reset the Track. A magnetic spring uses the force of repulsion between two magnets to create the necessary spring force. The 'strength' or 'snappiness' of the spring can be controlled by altering the number and size of the magnets in the repulsive pairs.
