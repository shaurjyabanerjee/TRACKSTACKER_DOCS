# **Double Button**

<img src="/img/TRACKS/stx-DB2.jpg" style="display: block; margin: auto;">


## **Overview**

The Double Button can be used to simultaneously launch two marbles in adjacent Tracks to create Marble Races and Marble Runs!

The Double Button is essentially two [IB2]s joined at the hip, which you actuate at the exact same moment by pressing the Button! This makes it so you can set up two parallel SubStacks, and race marbles through them with your friends (or enemies)!

!!! note 

	Most people race to see who is fastest, but in TrackStacker it is equally fun (if not more fun) to see who can build the **slowest** Stack!

## **Application Notes**

This Button can be used in a similar fashion to the Inline Button family of Tracks - to launch waiting marbles into a Stack, but this Track in particular has a lot of gamification potential!

## **Operational Principle**

The Double Button use a magnetic spring in order to create the spring force needed to reset the Track. A magnetic spring uses the force of repulsion between two magnets to create the necessary spring force. The 'strength' or 'snappiness' of the spring can be controlled by altering the number and size of the magnets in the repulsive pairs.
