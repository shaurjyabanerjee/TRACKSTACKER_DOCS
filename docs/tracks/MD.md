	[MD1] is shown in the Diverge mode in the image above

## **Overview**

The Merge/Diverge family of Tracks is designed to provide a simple inline Merge or Diverge for marbles on adjacent SubStacks. Merge/Diverge is currently only available in one size - [MD1], which has an Inter-Track Spacing of 1 unit. 

Merge/Diverge can be switched from Merge mode to Diverge mode simply by flipping the Track upside down!

[MD2], [MD3] and [MD4] are coming soon, with Inter Track Spacing's of 2, 3 and 4 units respectively!

## **Application Notes**

Merge/Diverge when used in Diverge mode is an easy way to add some randomness to your Stacks, by creating two-way junctions that marbles can 'choose' which way to go!

When used in a perfectly vertical orientation, [MD] acts as a 50/50 biased Diverge, but the ratio of probability can be biased one way or another by tilting the Track slightly in either direction. You can use a bubble level to set the Track perfectly level if you need a perfectly even randomness distribution for your Stack.
