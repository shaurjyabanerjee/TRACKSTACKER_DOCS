## OVERVIEW

The [<30] family of Tracks can be used to create a 30 degree bend in a Track. It is currently only available in one size [<30-D2]

[<30-D2] has half the angle as [<60-D2] and [J60-D2] and complements both of those Tracks beautifully when Stacking  

12x [<30-D2] tessellate together to form a regular Dodecagon




## APPLICATION NOTES


Two <90 Tracks can also be combined to create an S shaped redirect as shown below. Multiple S Redirects can be combined to create a wiggle shape. This shape can be expanded to any aspect ratio by interspersing Straight Tracks of desired lengths.

	This Track was formerly known as [DE] or Dodeca Elbow!
