# **<90 Family**

## OVERVIEW

The <90 family of Tracks can be used to create a 90 degree bend in a Track. They are currently available in 3 different sizes - [<90⌀1], [<90⌀2] and [<90⌀3]. 

The sizes have been designed such that if you combine two Right tracks to form a closed loop, they generate polygons with a diameter whose inter-track spacing is 1, 2 and 3 units respectively. 

This is the same standard of diameter that all other polygonal Tracks are also designed to. 



## APPLICATION NOTES


Two <90 Tracks can also be combined to create an S shaped redirect as shown below. Multiple S Redirects can be combined to create a wiggle shape. This shape can be expanded to any aspect ratio by interspersing Straight Tracks of desired lengths.
