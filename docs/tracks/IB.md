## **Overview**

The Inline Button Family of buttons can be used for launching a specific number of marbles into a Stack, simply at the push of a button! It is currently available in two sizes - [IB2] and [IB4]

- [IB2] launches two marbles with each button press
- [IB4] launches four marbles with each button press

## **Application Notes**

Inline Buttons can be used to quickly and easily add interactivity to any Stack! Using a funnel and some Straight Tracks into the inlet of an Inline Button keeps the button primed and ready to launch!

- If you setup the Inline Button with the arrow pointing **downwards**, the Track will release marbles when **the button is pressed.**


- On the other hand, if you setup the Inline Button with the arrow pointing **upwards**, the Track will release marbles when **the button is released.**

## **Operational Principle**

The Inline Buttons use a magnetic spring in order to create the spring force needed to reset the Track. A magnetic spring uses the force of repulsion between two magnets to create the necessary spring force. The 'strength' or 'snappiness' of the spring can be controlled by altering the number and size of the magnets in the repulsive pairs.
