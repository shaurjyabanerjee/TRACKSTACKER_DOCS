# **J60 Family**



## OVERVIEW

The J60 Family of Tracks are a regular 3-way junction where each leg has an angle of 60 degrees between it and its neighbor. J60 is currently only available in one size - [J60-D2] which is the same leg length as [<60-D2]

This Track combines very well with [<60-D2] and [<30-D2] which allow you to create parallel, converging and diverging Stacks with [J60-D2] at the heart.

## APPLICATION NOTES

Similarly to [<60-D2], [J60-D2] also tessellates into a hexagonal matrix (as shown in the image below) When combined with [<60-D2], all kinds of incredible honeycomb patterns can be created!
