## OVERVIEW

The [<60] family of Tracks can be used to create a 60 degree bend in a Track. It is currently only available in one size [<60⌀2]

[<60⌀2] has the same leg length as Triad [TRD] and complements that Track beautifully

6x [<60⌀2] tessellate together to form a regular Hexagon




## APPLICATION NOTES


Two <90 Tracks can also be combined to create an S shaped redirect as shown below. Multiple S Redirects can be combined to create a wiggle shape. This shape can be expanded to any aspect ratio by interspersing Straight Tracks of desired lengths.
