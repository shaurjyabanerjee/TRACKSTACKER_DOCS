## OVERVIEW

The Straight family of Tracks are the basic building blocks of the TrackStacker ecosystem. They can be used to connect any two Tracks together, and are available in a variety of different lengths, grouped into two main families based on the base multiple of each available length. 

### **x30mm multiples** - [S30], [S60], [S120], [S120]

In general, it is recommended to Stack with x30mm Straight Tracks, as they are all exact multiples of Inter Track Spacing, they tend to work well with dense, angular Stacks

### **x20mm multiples** - [S20], [S40], [S80], [S60], [S200]

x20mm Straight Tracks can be very useful in combination with certain buttons and gates that have a length of 40mm. 


## APPLICATION NOTES

Straight Tracks range in length from 20mm to 240mm. They can be used at any angle, and can be combined to make longer Straight Tracks. They are all provided with a dovetail key design so that they can be used to build high pressure Stacks (like in a Marble Pump)
