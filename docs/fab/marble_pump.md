## **Introduction**

The Marble Pump 1.0 is finally here, 


## **Bill of Materials**

- #### **1x** **[DC Gear Motor](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C3W4NTVB/ref=twister_B0C7GV2FD1?th=1)**

	The beating heart of the Marble Pump is this little right angle DC Gearmotor. The Marble Pump has been designed and tested around a motor rated for 24V / 10RPM. However, slower and faster motors could be used to achieve different pump performance characteristics. There are a large variety of voltages and RPMs avaialble in this form factor.

- #### **1x** **[DPDT (on-off-on) Toggle Switch](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0799JV8GN/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)**

	This switch will act as the entire direction control system for the pump.

- #### **1x** **[USB C PD Trigger PCB](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CWNVBJT1/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1)**

	This little PCB lets you select what voltage you want to run your pump at from the available voltages your USB-C PD power supply provides. To get maximum pump speed, you will need a USB-C PD charger that can provide upto 20V.
