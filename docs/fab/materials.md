## **Fundamental Ingredients**

There are four fundamental materials required in order to create your own TrackStacker Sets - 

- ### **10mm Glass Marbles**

	Any glass marbles 10mm in diameter will function well in TrackStacker. Be cautious of marbles that are too far over or under the nominal dimension of 10mm. 9.5mm - 10.5mm marbles have been tested to work well in all Tracks. We have found Jan’s Jewellery Supply to be a reliable supplier for 10mm marbles in a variety of colors and finishes. 

- ### **⌀6mm ↧2mm Magnets**

	6mm diameter x 2mm depth Neodymium Magnets are also known as Con Magnets in the TrackStacker ecosystem and are typically responsible for attaching Tracks to each other. You can source fridge magnets of this diameter from online suppliers like Amazon.

- ### **⌀8mm ↧3mm Magnets**

	8mm diameter x 3mm depth Neodymium Magnets are also known as Board Magnets in the TrackStacker ecosystem and are typically responsible for attaching Tracks to the Play Surface. You can source fridge magnets of this diameter from online suppliers like Amazon.


- ### **PLA Filament** 

	TrackStacker Labs recommends fabricating your own Tracks using PLA, but other filaments like PETG, ABS, ASA, PC and PA6 can be substituted if making outdoor grade Tracks.  TrackStacker Labs uses BambuLab PLA Matte for all in house Track production.
