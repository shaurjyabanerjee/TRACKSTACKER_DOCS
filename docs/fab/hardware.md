# **Hardware**

Some Tracks use standard M2 metric hardware as a fastener for joining cover plates to Tracks like in [MD1] or [<60-D2], and for joining parts within multi-part Tracks like [2T1], [IB2], [DB2] etc.

Typically, all Tracks are designed to use M2 x 4mm Socket Head Cap Screws, but there are some exceptions where longer or shorter screws or different head styles may be specified for a particular Track. 

In general it is recommended to keep a variety pack of M2 hardware around if you plan on fabricating a lot of Tracks or plan on designing your own!

TrackStacker Labs uses stainless steel Socket Head Cap Screws for all in-house Track production.

## **Tracks using non-standard hardware**

- [CB] or Chaos Box requires M2x18mm long screws to securely screw into the body of the Chaos Box including a cover plate thickness of up to 2mm.
