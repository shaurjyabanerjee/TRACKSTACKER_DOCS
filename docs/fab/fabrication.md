## **Introduction**

Are you are interested in fabricating your own TrackStacker sets for yourself and your loved ones? If you have access to an FDM 3D printer, some basic hand tools and standard metric hardware, you too can be creating your own Track Stacker sets from the comfort of your home!

A few Tracks call for the fabrication of acrylic cover plates and need a CNC laser cutter, though 3D printed cover plates have been tested to work nicely as well.
