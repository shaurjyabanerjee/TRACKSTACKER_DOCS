# **Welcome to The TrackStacker Documentation Homepage!**

### **[Download the Files -](https://github.com/shaurjyabanerjee/TRACKSTACKER)**

If you would like to fabricate your own Tracks, you can download the latest version of the full TrackStacker Track Library using the link above on GitHub. This will give you access to all of the .STL and .DXF files for every Track and all the necessary Tooling to make magnetizing your own Tracks easier. 

If you've never used GitHub before, simply find and click the green “<>Code” button, and then select “Download ZIP” from the drop down menu. Wait for the file to download, then unzip and start fabricating!

You can then use [The Fabrication Guide](/fabrication) to learn how to setup and tune your 3D printer and properly set magnets to complete your Tracks! TrackStacker is an excellent first functional 3D printing project to build familiarity and experience with 3D printing!

### **How to use The Documentation -**

The TrackStacker Documentation is organized into four broad categories to make sure you have access to all the information you need, sorted to keep it from getting overwhelming. The entire TrackStacker Documentation website is text searchable, and you can use the search bar in the top right to find any particular topic you may be interested in.

You can navigate to each of the four main sections of the website using the main navigation buttons in the site header. You can navigate each of the subsections using the side navigation bar to quickly jump between different subsections. The four main sections of the website are -

- ### **[The Track Library -](/tracks/tracks)**
	
	The TrackLibrary acts as the 'user manual' for each Track in the TrackStacker Universe. You can find detailed information about every single Track in the Library, including its naming conventions, suggested Stack examples, suggested Track pairings, tips, tricks and more! The Track Library is full of photos and ideas to get you inspired to Stack!

- ### **[The Fabrication Guide -](/fabrication)**
	
	The Fabrication Guide is your centralized resource for all information relating to building your own Tracks at home! If you have access to a 3D printer, neodymium magnets, standard M2 metric hardware and some superglue - you too can be creating incredible TrackStacker sets from the comfort of your home! Building you own TrackStacker sets is also a fantastic way to get into functional 3D printing as a hobby!

- ### **[The Design Guide -](/design)**
	The Track Stacker Design Guide is a living document that captures the entire set of standards, technical information, drawings, hardware, processes, principles and logic that informs the design of every single Track, and considers the ways in which Tracks shall be combined for the best Stacking experience for the Player.
	
	The Design Guide is broken up into sections that compartmentalize each aspect of Track Stacker’s fundamental standards with technical drawings, descriptions and context for each design choice. This is to provide contributors with as much context as possible to integrate new designs into the Track Stacker Cinematic Universe!

- ### **[Changelog -](/changelog)**

	TrackStacker is a dynamic and constantly evolving Open Source project. We are constantly incorporating community feedback and revising and updating each Track to be the very best Track that it possibly can be. You can look at the Changelog to see an itemized list of all the changes and updates to the TrackStacker organized by date of release. 

	You can find information about revisions to the TrackStacker Standard here, as well as information about newly released Tracks, revisions and updates to existing Tracks, changes in Track names, and all the of the changes that TrackStacker has undergone since release.
