Even small inaccuracies in dimension can make the fitment of magnets and marbles frustrating, and lead to magnets not staying in their pockets and marbles jamming in their tracks.</p> <p>Before you start production on your own set, make sure to also take the time to tune your other 3D printer settings including support settings, elephant\u2019s foot compensation and the alignment of blobs from Z seams.</p> <p>Getting your print settings absolutely dialed in before you begin production will mean having to do minimal post processing on every part you make, saving lots of time and effort that could be better spent playing!</p> <p>It is recommended to print all parts for Track Stacker using PLA or any of its variants with the following settings for best finish quality and strength -</p> <ul> <li>Layer Height : 0.2mm</li> <li>Walls : 4</li> <li>Infill : 20% density, Tri-Hexagon pattern</li> <li>Supports : Standard</li> <li>Adhesion : Brims </li> </ul> <p>If you have a machine capable of multi material printing, you can set up your slicer to print the name and length codes in a second highlight color, adding both functionality and flair.

It is recommended to post process large batches of parts at the same time.</p> <p>The first step will be the removal of supports (if you used them) We recommend a small flat head screwdriver for prying supports off from the magnet pockets, keyway slots and any other features that may have required support. With good support settings, this should be very easy to do, all the supported features being shallow pockets with ease of access for removal.</p> <p>After all supports have been removed, conduct a thorough visual inspection of the part making sure there are no stray blobs, strings, wisps or other artifacts that may affect the quality and reliability of the finished Track. Use your fingers or a small file and flush cutters to trim away any artifacts.</p> <p>If there is any elephants foot on the part, use a small flat file to file away the elephants foot, especially on the mating surfaces between Tracks. Failure to do this will result in Tracks becoming poorly aligned at connections causing marble jams.</p> <p>Take the time to make sure each part meets all the above criteria for accuracy and finish to ensure the most enjoyable playtime Stacking experience!</p>"},{"location":"fabrication/#sourcing-","title":"Sourcing  -","text":"<p>There are two different sizes of neodymium magnets you will need to insert into your 3D printed parts to create finished Tracks.

A dead blow hammer, a flat stable and solid work surface about 200mm x 200mm and a set of small pin punches will make the process of setting magnets much easier. This approach is usually fine for setting small quantities of magnets, but you may want to invest in a Vice or Arbor Press based setting system if you intend to fabricate LARGE quantities of Tracks.</p> <p>Track Stacker is designed to use a tight friction fit for the magnets such that no adhesive is necessary in assembly. However, if you find your magnets falling out of their pockets in play due to poor 3D printer tolerances, you can use a small dab of gel superglue when setting your magnets to ensure longevity of the finished Track. </p>"},{"location":"fabrication/#magnet-polarity-","title":"Magnet Polarity -","text":"<p>Setting your magnets with the correct polarity is essential for your finished Tracks to pass the final Function Test with flying colors.
